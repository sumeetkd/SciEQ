For films grown on miscut SrTiO 3 the b axis is out of plane and the low-temperature width of the stripes is $200 nm. When the film grows with the b axis in the film plane, the low-temperature width of the stripes is more than a micron. This difference is attributed to shape dependence of the demagnetization factor. The domain-wall width cannot be measured directly with Lorentz microscopy, and based on the magnetic anisotropy, it was estimated to be $3 nm (see also Sec. IV.A.2). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements (Asulin et al., 2006) on thin epitaxial SrRuO 3 =ð100ÞYBa 2 Cu 3 O 7À ferromagnet and superconductor bilayers suggest that the superconductor order parameter survives in regions in the vicinity of the domain walls, and based on the width of these regions, the domain-wall width was estimated to be less than 10 nm (see Fig. 29 ). The nature of the domains and the domain walls make them attractive for transport measurements, as discussed below. The stray field generated by the domain structure has also been used to suppress the superconducting critical current in Nb films in bilayers with SrRuO 3 (Feigenson et al., 2005) .'}, {'paper_id': '116975483', 'text': 'Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) uses one probe to measure surface conductivity by measuring the current tunneling between the probe and a grounded sample. However, STS is mainly dependent on transport though the tunneling junction, rather than the underlying properties of the material, although the junction formed is indicative of those material properties. Two point probe measurements can be used to measure nanoscale conductivity but are also dependent on the contact resistance caused by the barrier formation and the resistance of the wires connecting the probes. In three probe measurements, a current is passed through the two outer probes and a third scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) probe is used to map the potential at the surface.'}, {'paper_id': '13992446', 'text': 'Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments on Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8þy (Bi2212) at moderate magnetic fields and low temperatures showed that vortices induce a checkerboard pattern of the local density of states with a spatial period of 15 A % 4a 0 [3] . Further STM studies found such electronic ordering in Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6þ (Bi2201) [4] and Ca 2Àx Na x CuO 2 Cl 2 (NaCCOC) [5] persisting to nonsuperconducting dopings and above the superconducting transition temperature. Elastic neutron scattering experiments [6] [7] [8] on the cuprate superconductor, La 2 CuO 4þ (La214), produced magnetic Bragg reflections corresponding to a periodicity of 30 A % 8a 0 . Although spatially unresolved, this result was associated with the checkerboard pattern found from STM on Bi2212, since the period of a spin-density wave (SDW) is expected to be twice that found in the density of states.'}, {'paper_id': '119415272', 'text': 'Owing to the non-zero Berry flux between one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality, the surface states present as non-closed Fermi arc connecting this pair of Weyl points, which have been observed in several WSMs via Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) 3-13 . Beside Fermi arc surface states, WSMs also host exotic transport properties in the bulk, such as chiral anomaly effect [14] [15] [16] [17] , large magnetoresistance (MR) [14] [15] [16] [18] [19] [20] [21] , strong spin and anomalous Hall effect [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , gravitational anomaly effect 27 , even special catalyst effect 28 .'}, {'paper_id': '123106430', 'text': 'Changes of the magnetic exchange asymmetry in elastic spin-polarized electron scattering are also observed with increasing film thickness that may be due to changes in the spin polarized electron band structure above the vacuum level. The transition from a large monodomain structure with uniaxial magnetization to a granular multidomain structure between about 12 and 15 ML correlates with very significant changes of exchange asymmetry, film breakup, and appearance of relaxed bcc Fe. Further work is needed to develop a more comprehensive and possibly quantitative understanding of the relationship between changes in magnetic exchange asymmetry and the structural rearrangements reported here. The origin of a striking ferromagnetic thickness gap between 8 and 9 ML thickness is not clear, but could be related to the vertical relaxation of the film through finite size effects. The observed gap also bears a striking resemblance to behavior observed earlier in Fe/W(110) films, which was attributed to morphological frustration to long range order. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of film morphology would help to identify if a similar frustration could be responsible for the gap in Fe/W(111).'}, {'paper_id': '36315801', 'text': 'Heterojunction band offset engineering has been extensively utilized over the past decade both for improved device design and to enable better understanding of the fundamental properties of interfaces. 1 It is important to relate the fundamental properties, e.g. band offsets, with the detailed microscopic nature of the interface. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) are useful tools for this purpose. 2 It has been recently shown that possible complications in STS measurements due to tip-induced band bending can be effectively addressed using 3-dimensional electrostatic simulations along with a detailed computation of the tunneling current, thus enabling a quantitative interpretation of the experimental spectroscopic results. 3, 4, 5, 6 In x Ga 1-x P with x ≈ 0.5 (hereafter referred to as InGaP) is known to be lattice matched to GaAs. Its band gap is considerably larger than that of GaAs, so it has been proposed as an alternative to AlGaAs as a barrier material for heterostructures. 7 InGaP is potentially much better than AlGaAs for heterojunction bipolar transistors, since its much smaller conduction band (CB) offset results in a smaller electron-blocking spike that inhibits electron injection from the emitter into the base. 7 Depending on growth conditions, InGaP can exist either an ordered arrangement of cations or a disordered one, with band gaps of these forms differing by about 0.05 eV. 8 The InGaP studied in the present work is of the disordered variety, 9 with room-temperature band gap of about 1.90 eV. 10 The CB offset between InGaP and GaAs is known to be relatively small, [i.e. most of the band gap difference of eV 48 . 0 42 . 1 90'}, {'paper_id': '122648092', 'text': 'Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) 1, 2 is an essential technique of nanoscience to obtain atomic resolution images of adsorbed species.

The Hall resistivity ρ yx and magnetoresistance ρ xx were measured at the same time using the six-lead method with the applied field parallel to c-axis and perpendicular to the applied current. In order to decrease the contact resistance, we sputtered gold on the contact pads just after the cleavage, then attached gold wires on the contacts with silver paste. The Hall (MR) resistivity ρ yx (ρ xx ) was extracted from the difference (sum) of transverse (longitudinal) resistance measured at positive and negative fields, i.e., ρ yx (H )=[ρ yx (+H )-ρ yx (-H )]/2 and ρ xx (H )=[ρ xx (+H )+ρ xx (-H )]/2, which can effectively eliminate the longitudinal (transverse) resistivity component due to the misalignment of contacts.'}, {'paper_id': '4541440', 'text': 'Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can provide real space images of both filled and empty states and their local relationship to surface and near-surface impurities. STM also provides access to momentum space information via quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging. When quasiparticle states of energy ε scatter elastically from impurities, the interference between initial and final quasiparticle wavevectors k i and k f can result in a standing wave pattern with wavevector q = k f − k i at energy ε. The observed dispersion of q(ε), and the inversion of q(ε) to find k(ε), has established QPI as a reliable k-space probe [19] . Indeed, QPI imaging has been used to demonstrate the protection against backscattering [20, 21] and the high energy breakdown of linear dispersion in pristine Bi 2 Te 3 [22] , as well as the onset of backscattering in Fe x Bi 2−x Te 3 [23] . However, dispersing QPI in Bi 2 Se 3 has been elusive [17, 24, 25] , appearing only in a limited energy range with inconsistent velocity [26] [27] [28] .

In this work we demonstrate the formation of emergent correlated phases in multilayer rhombohedral graphene -a simple material that also exhibits a flat electronic band but without the need of having a moiré superlattice induced by twisted van der Waals layers. We show that two layers of bilayer graphene that are twisted by an arbitrary tiny angle host large (micronscale) regions of uniform rhombohedral four-layer (ABCA) graphene that can be independently studied. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals that ABCA graphene hosts an unprecedentedly sharp flat band of 3-5 meV half-width. We demonstrate that when this flat band straddles the Fermi level, a correlated many-body gap emerges with peak-to-peak value of 9.5 meV at charge neutrality. Mean field theoretical calculations indicate that the two primary candidates for the appearance of this broken symmetry state are a charge transfer excitonic insulator and a ferrimagnet. Finally, we show that ABCA graphene hosts surface topological helical edge states at natural interfaces with ABAB graphene which can be turned on and off with gate voltage, implying that small angle twisted double bilayer graphene is an ideal programmable topological quantum material.'}]
